# portfolio-project

This is my portfolio website.

I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create this page, and have added a few of the projects that I have completed on my WebDev journey so far.

I'm hoping to add to the projects and skills section in the future.

During this project, I tackled a few new tasks, including using JavaScript to a responsive dropdown Nav bar, and also the carousel for the projects.

I intend to keep working on this to add transitions to the carousel, and to also change the Header and Footer into a template, so it can be dynamically added to each page.
